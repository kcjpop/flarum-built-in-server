## Flarum Built-in Server

A drop-in to run PHP built-in server in [Flarum](https://github.com/flarum/flarum) for quick development/review/etc.

## Usage

Download/copy `server.php` and place it at the same level with `index.php` in Flarum installation.

Run `php -S 127.0.0.1:8888 server.php`.

## TODO

Convert into an extension when Flarum allows to register console commands.
